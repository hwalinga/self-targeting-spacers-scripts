The whole pipeline is roughly summarised in processors/pipeline.bash
If you want to use that, you probably need to change a lot in that file.
All folder locations and names are probably different for you.
This file is more as a guideline for what steps needs to be done
It is not tested or intended to use as an existing pipeline.
Adapting it to use as a data pipeline is probably feasible,
but for large amount of genomes rewriting in snakemake is probably a good choice.
